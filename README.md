## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed and available in your system's PATH:

1.  **Python:** Version 3.9 or newer. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
2.  **Poetry:** For dependency management. ([Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
3.  **FFmpeg:** For audio extraction and burning subtitles. ([Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
4.  **mpv:** For the embedded video player. ([Download mpv](https://mpv.io/installation/))
5.  **Git:** For cloning the repository. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/))

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ozzy-420/auto-subs.git
    cd auto-subs
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Poetry:**
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all necessary packages.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    *Note: If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you may benefit from installing a CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch manually before running `poetry install`. Follow the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).*

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    poetry run python main.py
    ```

4.  **Whisper Model Download:**
    The first time you run a transcription, the application will download the specified Whisper model (default: `tiny`). This requires a one-time internet connection. Subsequent uses will be fully offline.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Load Video:** Launch the application and go to `File > Import Video...` to load your video file. Alternatively, open a project with `File > Open Project...`.
2.  **Automatic Transcription:** If you loaded a new video, the transcription process can be started from the toolbar.
3.  **Edit & Refine:**
    *   The transcribed segments appear on the timeline at the bottom.
    *   Click a segment on the timeline to select it. This will open the **Word Editor** in the left panel.
    *   In the Word Editor, you can modify text, adjust timestamps, or add/delete words.
4.  **Style Your Subtitles:**
    *   Switch to the **Style Editor** in the left panel.
    *   Customize fonts, colors, alignment, and more. Your changes will be reflected in the video preview in real-time.
    *   Save your configuration via `Style > Save Style As...` for future use.
5.  **Export Your Work:**
    *   **Subtitle File:** Go to `File > Export as...` to save your work as an `.srt`, `.ass`, or `.txt` file.
    *   **Burned-in Video:** Choose `File > Export as MP4...` to create a new video file with the subtitles permanently rendered on the frames.
6.  **Save Your Project:**
    *   Use `File > Save Project` or `File > Save Project As...` to save all your progress into a single `.asproj` file.
